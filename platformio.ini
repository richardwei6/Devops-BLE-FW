; support .mbedignore to not waste time building all the not-useful code like cell modems
; https://github.com/Copper-Bot/PlatformIO-Helpers
; .mbedignore file adapted from
; https://forums.mbed.com/t/how-to-shorten-compilation-time-up-to-six-times/11203
; but with comments deleted and syntax modified for the mbedignore script
; and updated to reflect changes to the mbed libraries structure
; These were also un-ignored to allow BLE to build:
